        <p>Having a secure Password is the most important part of your online security, so how do you keep and know a good password?</p>

<h2>Password managers</h2>

In the modern day you do not need to remember your passwords thanks to password managers! But what password managers can you turst and use?
<p>I only suggest one password manager, that being <a href="https://keepassxc.org">KeePassXC</a>, and the reason why I suggest KeePassXC is because the source code is available to view so you know you can trust it, and the other reason why I suggest using KeePassXC is because it is offline, meaning nobody can hack an online account; instead, they have to obtain the password.kdbx file on your computer, which is harder to do than hacking an online account.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that KeePassXC works offline with a .kdbx file, I suggest having a spare USB stick with a backup on it just in case it gets deleted for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Syncing all of your passwords between devices is easy with KeePassXC; I just use <a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a> to do so. It is easy to setup, and I have never had any issues with it!</p>

<h2>What makes a good password?</h2>
<p>A good password should be made up of totally random charicters that have no relation to you as a person.</p>
<p>An example of a weak password would be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Grace'sPassword123</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And an example of a strong password would be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>{gÙIjWÝ0ó{Ðö÷åQü9+òÀË×?Ì¯Áv</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now you might see why you should have a password manager, so it can remember stuff like this for you!</p>
<p>I do suggest your password to be longer than 16 charicters!</p>

        <p>Formatting a USB in Linux is easier then <a href="01BurningIsos">burning an ISO</a> and only needs a few quick commands!</p>
<hr>
<h2>What you will need 📋</h2>
<ul>
<li>A USB drive</li>
<li>A computer with Linux 🐧🖥</li>
<li>The ability to read instructions and to follow them 🧠</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Formatting the USB</h2>
<ol>
<li>The first thing you want to do is plug in your USB stick and identify the USB stick's name.</li>
</ol>
<p>lsblk</p>
<p>Normally the USB will be something like sdX; a tip on identifying it is by looking at the size of the USB in the table that lsblk gives you!</p>
<hr>
<ol start="2">
<li>Now you need to use a program called <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/fdisk">fdisk</a> that will allow you to create a new partition table for the USB, this will format the USB.</li>
</ol>
<p>sudo fdisk /dev/sdX</p>
<p>You will need to press the following keys to make a new partition table for the USB.</p>
<ul>
<li>o - Creates a new DOS partition table</li>
<li>n - New partition, press enter to all that follows</li>
<li>w - Writes the partition table</li>
</ul>
<p>Give fdisk a minute to write the new partition to the USB.</p>
<hr>
<ol start="3">
<li>Now is the time to give that partition a file system. You should look into this beforehand to see what file system you want, but I will use fat32 because it works with all operating systems.</li>
</ol>
<p>sudo mkfs.fat -F 32 -n &quot;Backup-USB&quot; /dev/sdXx</p>
<p>The small x represents the number of the partition; the -L flag is used to give the USB stick a name.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Finished ✅</h2>
<p>All done! Now you have an empty USB stick you can use for all your files!</p>

        <p>This is a quick tutorial to show you how to burn any file to a piece of optical disk media!</p>
<hr>
<h3>Warning ⚠️</h3>
<p>Once you burn an optical disk you cannot reburn it.</p>
<p>Optical media does not have the best storage, normally under 1GiB so make sure your files align with the size of the optical media.</p>
<hr>
<h2>What you will need 📋</h2>
<ul>
<li>Optical drive capable of writing to a CD</li>
<li>A computer with Linux 🐧🖥️</li>
<li>The ability to read instructions and to follow them 🧠</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Steps to burn 🔥</h2>
<p>You will only need one program to burn media to a CD; the name of that program is <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/wodim">wodim</a>, and it is part of a collection of programs called <a href="https://packages.debian.org/source/sid/cdrkit">cdrkit</a>, as in thename ofe this collection of programs that allow you to do a whole variaty of things withopticall media!</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Install cdrkit, on some Linux distrobutions cdrkit is already installed, but on my main Linux distrobution <a href="https://archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a>, it is not so check you have it installed, the package on your distro will most likely be called cdrkit.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo pacman -S cdrkit</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<ol start="2">
<li>You want to get whatever data you want into an ISO file, so if you had a file called movies that held movies you would use the command. As an example, I will be using the location of the Fallout 1 installation files on my system.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>mkisofs -o Fallout.iso -V &quot;Fallout 1&quot; ~/Downloads/Fallout<br>
Fallout.iso being the output ISO and ~/Downloads/Fallout being the directory with the movies in there.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<ol start="3">
<li>Now the last command is the actual event of burning the optical media! So insert it into your optical drive and type this command.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>cdrecord -v dev=/dev/cdrom ~/Downloads/Fallout.iso<br>
movies.iso being the output ISO from the last command.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Now it is time to sit back and wait for it to burn; do not get impatient; give it time, and it will burn. When it is done, you may enject the optical media from the CD drive, and it should have all the files you desire.</p>

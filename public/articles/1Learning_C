            <h2>Learning the C programming language</h2>
            <h3>Date: 10:6:2024</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Hello there, I have not updated this website in the last few days or posted much to GitLab, so I thought I might as well publish something to keep some people updated.</p>

            <p>So as the title implies, I have been learning the C programming language recently, and it has been fun. I am still at the basics, and I have tests coming up, but I am doing my best with the time I have! i  While I have been learning, I have been making a kind of tutorial file from the tutorial videos I have watched, so when I believe it is fully ready, I will publish it to GitLab.</p>

            <p>It has been a few weeks, and I have not made much progress, sadly. I have been quite busy with school, but I have more free time now, so I will have more time to study. I am happy I have more time because I have been really falling behind on learning C. </p>

            <h3>Date: 8:7:2024</h3> 
            <p>Hello there! It has been a little while since I last updated this page. I have added some of the resources I use today, so that is a plus for you to read if you are curious! But the main bit of news is that I have is that I have rewrote my programme <a href=../projects/programs/Fakefetch#info>Fakefetch</a> in the C programmeming language. It was a bit of a challenging, and I needed some help with troubleshooting, but I got there in the end. I have expanded on my notes, and when I am ready, I shall publish what I have done so far. But for now, that is all. Thank you for reading.</p>

            <h2>Learning the C programming language</h2>
            <h3>Date: 10:6:2024</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Hello there, I have not updated this website in the last few days or posted much to GitLab, so I thought I might as well publish something to keep some people updated.</p>

            <p>So as the title implies, I have been learning the C programming language recently, and it has been fun. I am still at the basics, and I have tests coming up, but I am doing my best with the time I have! i  While I have been learning, I have been making a kind of tutorial file from the tutorial videos I have watched, so when I believe it is fully ready, I will publish it to GitLab.</p>

            <h3>Date: 27:6:2024</h3>
            <p>It has been a few weeks, and I have not made much progress, sadly. I have been quite busy with school, but I have more free time now, so I will have more time to study. I am happy I have more time because I have been really falling behind on learning C. </p>

            <font color="#800000">This page is still being updated as I learn more C so keep checking in! </font>

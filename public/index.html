            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
            Hello there! I am Shipwreckt, a 15-year-old dude who lives in the UK. I would describe
            myself as an outgoing person, and I enjoy talking to people even if I do not know them well.
            </p>

            <p>I have enjoyed programming for a number of years now, ever since early
            2022, but I only really delved into programming fully in late 2023, when I
            fully switched from Windows to Linux. The reason why I made the switch
            was because even though I can see Windows is not all that great, I wanted
            to challenge myself and also give myself a reason to program again, so I
            switched over to Linux, and it has been amazing. It has given me the
            freedom to be creative with my desktop and config files. But I am
            currently learning the C programming language, and I am planning on
            making some more programs, so keep your eyes peeled for when I do! 
            </p>

            <h3>Hardware</h3>
            <p>I am daily driving a <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Review-Lenovo-ThinkPad-L440-Notebook.107632.0.html">ThinkPad
            L440</a> made in 2013, its keyboard feels like heaven, definitely the best keyboard I have
            ever used my hands just glide over it. It is durable as hell, I have dropped this thing a
            few times no dents or scratches, I know it has a roll cage in it so this laptop will last
            me forever. I have 8GB of RAM in this laptop
            which I will upgrade at some point and im using a I5-4200M CPU. Overall it is an amazing
            laptop and I believe I can use this laptop for the rest of my life.</p>
    
            <h3>Software</h3>
            <p><b>Linux distro</b><br>
            I use arch, mainly because I am making my own work environment and I can pick what
            applications I want to install instead of some linux distro that does it for me, the
            beauty of Arch Linux is that you're held responsible nothing happens unless you let it
            happen. There is a learning curve but when you break it, it is more than worth it for
            the amount of freedom you get from Arch.

            <p><b>Web browser</b><br>
            For my web browser is <a href "https://librewolf.net/">librewolf</a> the only browser that
            really cares about your privacy, whilst yes it is annoying being logged out of everything
            each time I close it, small sacrifices need to be made for privacy  and this is why password managers
            exist I just log on in a matter of seconds. I don't use many extensions but the ones I do use are 
            <a href "https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">ublock</a> ,
            <a href "https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keepassxc-browser/">KeePassXC</a> ,
            <a href "https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/">Dark reader</a>.</p>

            <p><b>IDE</b><br>My IDE is Vim, it is a good all around program to use, it is fast to work with and is very
            customizable which I love personally, I would recommend vim for anybody who wants a
            terminal based text editor and to anybody who wants to get into programming or anybody
            who is programming currently.</p>

            <p><b>Password manager</b><br>
            I use <a href="https://keepassxc.org/">KeePassXC</a> for managing my passwords, I
            used to use bitwarden but after a while I just thought I did not want my passwords in
            somebody else's server so I switched to KeePassXC because it is offline, I use syncthing
            to sync all my passwords from my laptop to my phone.</p>

            <p><b>File manager</b><br>
            For my file manager, I use <a href ="https://github.com/ranger/ranger">Ranger</a>.
            The main reason I use Ranger is because it uses Vim keybinds,
            which I love. I first tested it out to see if it was any good, and after using it for about a
            day, I decided to fully switch over to it, and it is a good file manager. I would suggest it to
            anybody who likes the vim keybinds. </p>
            <p><b>Status bar</b><br>
            <a href "https://github.com/polybar">Polybar</a>
            is the software that I use for my status bar because it is very customizable and it has all
            the features I look for in a status bar, it it also has a clean and modern look by
            deafult. Sometimes I just mess around with my polybar and see what looks the best.</p>

            <p><b>App launcher</b><br>
            I use <a href "https://github.com/davatorium/rofi">rofi</a> for my app launcher because
            it is customizable and easy to use, it also comes with a bunch of default options which
            I sometimes use as a template for my rofi configs.</p>

            <p><b>Xorg or Wayland?</b><br>
            I like Wayland; it is smooth and modern. But I do not think it is fully there yet, so for
            now I am staaying with Xorg, because it just works and I have no issues with it. In the future,
            in about a year, I will switch to Wayland because it is more modern, but for now, Xorg is my go-to.</p>

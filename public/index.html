                <h2>Welcome To Shipwreckt</h2>
                <p>Hello and welcome to my personal website! For the most part this website is
                mostly about my programming work I have done, you can find all my coding projects on
                the projects page. I do a weekly news artical called the weekly byte where I do a
                Linux distro of the week and some software and hardware suggestions, also the odd
                bit of news. But that is mostly it for this website have a look around and see what
                you like!</p>
                <br>
                <p>Also quick note this website is still being made so please be patiant</p>

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello there! I am Shipwreckt, a 15-year-old dude who lives in the UK, if you
                cannot tell I like to program!</p>
                
                <p>I have enjoyed programming for a number of years now, ever since early 2022, but I
                only really delved into programming fully in late 2023, when I fully switched from
                Windows to Linux. The reason why I made the switch was because even though I can see
                Windows is not all that great, I wanted to challenge myself and also give myself a
                reason to program again, so I switched over to Linux, and it has been amazing. It
                has given me the freedom to be creative with my desktop and config files. But I am
                currently learning the C programming language, and I am planning on making some more
                programs, so keep your eyes peeled for when I do!</p>

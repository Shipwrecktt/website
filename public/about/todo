      <h1>What Am I Up To?</h1>
      <p>Last updated: 28-08-2024</p><hr>

      <h2>Religion</h2>
      <p>Going to Church this saturday, this will be my first time so wish me luck!</p>

      <h2>Website</h2>
      <p>As normal I am working on my website, for now I am mostly adding infomation about Linux and junk. I will keep this up for a while because I am trying to master Linux</p>

      <h2>Thinkpads</h2>
      <p>I am looking for an older Thinkpad that I can Libreboot, I have always wanted to do this because having a fully free software computer would just be something nice to have! So I am going to keep an eye on ebay and such for a nice thinkpad that is on the <a href="https://libreboot.org/docs/hardware/">Libre boot compatibility list</a>. Another reason why I want to Libreboot an older Thinkpad is because I want to give it some life and ideally turn it into a faster cleaner machine!</p>

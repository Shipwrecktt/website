      <h1>What Am I Up To?</h1>
      <p>Last updated: 17-04-2025</p><hr>

      <h2>School</h2>
      <p>I have mostly been focusing on school so I will not be able to program as much as before.</p>

      <h2>Games</h2>
      <p>Many people have their own ways of dealing with stress and such, mine is gaming. I am playing all of the classic fallout games! As of writing I am playing fallout 1 and I am so close to the end I just want to do a bunch of side quests beforehand.</p>

      <h2>Self improvement</h2>
      <p>Lately I have been working on myself a lot lately and I don't mean that in a hippie way or anything. I have been cleaning my room a lot, keeping the garden clean and doing fitness. It has helped me cope during exams, better then 4 hour gaming sessions.</p>

      <h2>Website</h2>
      <p>As normal I am working on my website, for now I am mostly adding infomation about Linux and junk. I will keep this up for a while because I am trying to master Linux. I am also trying to get a email server up and working but vultur and digitalocean are being asses sadly, what a guy gotta do to have the SMTP porn unblocked.</p>

      <h3>Hardware</h3>
      <p>I am daily driving a <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Review-Lenovo-ThinkPad-L440-Notebook.107632.0.html">ThinkPad L440</a> made in 2013, its keyboard feels like heaven, definitely the best keyboard I have ever used my hands just glide over it. It is durable as hell, I have dropped this thing a few times no dents or scratches, I know it has a roll cage in it so this laptop will last me forever. I have 8GB of RAM in this laptop which I will upgrade at some point and im using a I5-4200M CPU. Overall it is an amazing laptop and I believe I can use this laptop for the rest of my life if it lasts that long.</p>

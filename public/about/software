      <h3>Linux distro</h3>
      I use <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>, mainly because I am able to create my own work environment and I can pick what
      applications I want to install instead of most linux distros that does it for the user, the
      beauty of Arch Linux is that you are held responsible, nothing happens unless you let it
      happen. There is a learning curve but when you break it, it is more than worth it for
      the amount of freedom you get from Arch. It is also pretty fun to play with!

      <h3>Window manager</h3>
      <p>For my window manager, I use <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/">DWM</a> because it is lightweight, fast, does the job, and allows me to learn C while configuring it. There is also a large selection of patches to DWM meaning you can modify it to your hearts content! What's not to like?</p>

       <h3>Web browser</h3>
       <p>For my web browser is <a href "https://librewolf.net/">librewolf</a>, the only browser that
       really cares about your privacy, whilst yes it is annoying being logged out of everything
       but this is why password managers exist.
       exist I just log on in a matter of seconds. I don't use many extensions but the ones I do use are
       <a href "https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">ublock</a> ,
       <a href "https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keepassxc-browser/">KeePassXC</a> ,
       <a href "https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/">Dark reader</a>.</p>

       <h3>IDE</h3>
       <p>My IDE is Neovim, the reason why I use Neovim instead of something like <b>Visual Studio Code</b> is because it is simple and the keybinds are to die for, so if you want a simple easy IDE, I would suggest Neovim !</p>

       <h3>Password manager</h3>
       <p>I use <a href="https://keepassxc.org/">KeePassXC</a> for managing my passwords, I
       used to use bitwarden but after a while I just thought I did not want my passwords in
       somebody else's server so I switched to KeePassXC because it is offline, I use syncthing
       to sync all my passwords from my laptop to my phone.</p>

       <h3>File manager</h3>
       <p>For my file manager, I mostly use <a href ="https://github.com/ranger/ranger">Ranger</a>. The main reason I use Ranger is because it uses Vim keybinds and well I just love Vim keybinds! The only problem is I still sometimes use thunar for small things like mounting USB sticks and interacting with websites, but apart from that I only really use Ranger!</p>

       <h3>App launcher</h3>
       <p>I use <a href="https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/">Dmenu</a> for my app launcher because it works well with DWM and is simple and small !</p> 

       <h3>Xorg or Wayland?</h3>
       <p>I like Wayland; it is smooth and modern. But I do not think it is fully there yet, so for
       now I am staaying with Xorg, because it just works and I have had no issues with it. In the future,
       in about a year (2025), I will switch to Wayland because it is much more modern, but for now, Xorg is my go-to.</p>

            <h2>Qtile config</h2>
            <p>
            Qtile is a desktop environment that is written in the Python programming language. If you
            have any knowledge of programming, you might think, how slow is that? Well, it is not really
            slow. I have not had any issues with Qtile, and I have only had good experiences with it. It
            has been very fun customising it over the time I have been there and making it my own little
            by little! If you know how to programme in Python, it is very fun just to toy around with and
            customise, so if you want a really hackable desktop environment for Linux, I would suggest Qtile
            a thousand times over!
            </p>

            <p>
            In both my Qtile configs, laptop and Pc configs I have it set out rather simpily,
            I have an install script that sets up my config.py for qtile and asks you if you want
            to install some of software that I use. I also have an auto install script that I use
            most of the time. These install scripts are written in bash script because they are one 
            use and it is easier to just do it in bash if its a one use thing that I will delete
            afterwards.
            </p>

            <p>
            Some of my favourite software I have in the install.sh is Mpv and youtube-dl, this is
            because it allows me to watch youtube videos in my terminal. This is further enhanced
            by the ytfzf command that allows me to browes videos in my terminal. The reason why I
            like this is because youtube has became very annoying. They have games on that website now and
            whenever I serch something it only shows like 4 valid resaults, whilst ytfzf shows me
            nothing but valid resaults.
            </p>

            <p>
            Another good bit of software my install.sh installs is  librewolf, a privacy centered brower
            that acctually cares about your privacy unlike firefox. Whilst I do like firefox it has
            decended from what it once was and you need to install a custom user.js to become really
            secsure. Whilst with librewolf iy just does it for you and gives you settings on what
            you want to enable. I like librewolf because I know that the brower is designed to keep
            ne safe and that makes me feel well safe.
            </p>

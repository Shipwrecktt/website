            <h2>Fakefetch</h2>
            <p>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            Fakefetch is the first real program I have ever created that I use daily apart from
            config files. I made fakefetch when I saw people complaining about neofetch being slow that is why
            I have called it fakefetch. In the start it was just 10 lines of bash echo commands which is
            like printing in python, so it was bascially bare theminimun, and I was not proud of this
            program I was like ok thats done just add it to my .bashrc and continue using Linux.
            After about a day I wanted to see if I could add more to it like the uptime, then comes
            what package manager im using and after a while I have made my own mini neofetch program
            that I can use on all of my computers.
            </p>

            <h3>What is Fakefetch</h3>
            <p>Fakefetch is alternative to neofetch, it is written in bash script like neofetch
            but is not a billion lines long or bloated.

            <h3>Why Fakefetch?</h3>
            <p>The main reason why you should use Fakefetch is because it is a very flexible 
            program being written in bash script; it is not a large program, only being one file
            large and does not slow down your computer at all unlike Neofetch. Fakefetch is also
            very hackable thanks to how I have commented on the code, meaning you can make your own 
            Fakefetch versions and make it do whatever you want thanks to it being licensed under the
            GPL, so you have the right to redistribute it if you make your own versions that you can share
            with anybody.</p>
            
            <h3>How to install</h3>
            <p>I have made it very easy to install fakefetch by automating most of it for you.
            <li>Step one: The first thing you want to do is clone the gitlab project, you can do
            this from the following command.<br>
            $ git clone https://gitlab.com/Shipwreckt/fakefetch</li>
            <li>Step two: after cloneing the project you want to run the setup.sh with ./setup.sh</li>
            <li>To configure Fakefetch the file is located at /bin/fakefetch</p>
            
            <p>Here is an example of fakefetch!</p>

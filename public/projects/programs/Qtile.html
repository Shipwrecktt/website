                <h2><b>Qtile config</b></h2>
                <h3>Overview</h3><p>
                Qtile is a desktop environment that is written in the Python programming language. If you
                have any knowledge of programming, you might think, how slow is that? Well, it is not really
                slow. I have not had any issues with Qtile, and I have only had good experiences with it. It
                has been very fun customising it over the time I have been there and making it my own little
                by little! If you know how to programme in Python, it is very fun just to toy around with and
                customise, so if you want a really hackable desktop environment for Linux, I would suggest Qtile
                a thousand times over!
                </p>
                
                <h2>Install scripts</h2>
                <p>
                In the gitlab repo there is two files, an install.sh and an autoinstall.sh. The
                install.sh asks you if you what programs you want to download whilst the autoinstall
                installs without asking. These scripts just install software and fireware I use. If
                you want to modify the scripts it should be easy since it is written in bash, all
                you really need to do is put in package names you want.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Software</h2>
                <p>
                Some of my favourite software I have in the my install scripts is Mpv and youtube-dl, this is
                because it allows me to watch youtube videos in my terminal. This is further enhanced
                by the ytfzf command that allows me to browes videos in my terminal. The reason why I
                like this is because youtube has became very annoying. They have games on that website now and
                whenever I serch something it only shows like 4 valid resaults, whilst ytfzf shows me
                nothing but valid resaults.
                </p>

                <p>
                Another good bit of software my install scripts is  librewolf, a privacy centered brower
                that acctually cares about your privacy unlike firefox. Whilst I do like firefox it has
                decended from what it once was and you need to install a custom user.js to become really
                secsure. Whilst with librewolf iy just does it for you and gives you settings on what
                you want to enable. I like librewolf because I know that the brower is designed to keep
                ne safe and that makes me feel well safe.

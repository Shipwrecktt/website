                <h2>Fakefetch</h2>
                <h3><b>Background</b></h3>
                <p>
                Fakefetch is the first real program I have ever created that I use daily apart from config
                files. I made fakefetch when I saw people complaining about neofetch being slow that is why
                I have called it fakefetch. In the start it was just 10 lines of bash echo commands which is
                like printing in python, so it was bascially bare theminimun, and I was not proud of this
                program I was like ok thats done just add it to my .bashrc and continue using Linux. After
                about a day I wanted to see if I could add more to it like the uptime, then comes what
                package manager im using and after a while I have made my own mini neofetch program that I
                can use on all of my computers.
                </p>

               <h3><b>What is Fakefetch</b></h3>
               <p>Fakefetch is alternative to neofetch, it is written in bash script like neofetch
               but is not a billion lines long or bloated.

               <h3><b>Why Fakefetch?</b></h3>
               <p>The main reason why you should use Fakefetch is because it is a very flexible program
                being written in bash script; it is not a large program, only being one file large and does
                not slow down your computer at all unlike Neofetch. Fakefetch is also very hackable thanks
                to how I have commented on the code, meaning you can make your own Fakefetch versions and
                make it do whatever you want thanks to it being licensed under the GPL, so you have the
                right to redistribute it if you make your own versions that you can share with anybody.</p>

                <h3><b>How to install</b></h3>
                <li>Step one: The first thing you want to do is clone the gitlab project, you can do
                this from the following command.<br>$ git clone https://gitlab.com/Shipwreckt/fakefetch</li></p>

                <p><li>Step two: after cloneing the project you want to run the setup.sh with
                ./setup.sh</li></p>

                <p><li>To configure Fakefetch the file is located at /bin/fakefetch</p>
                <p>Here is an example of fakefetch!</p>

                <h2><b>Dotfiles</b></h2>
                <h3>What are Dotfiles?</h3><p>
                The reason I have dotfiles is for a few reasons. The first is that I use my PC and a
                few laptops interchangeably, and having my configurations easily downloadable is a
                big time saver. The second reason why I have my dotfiles up is because maybe
                somebody is looking for a certain baseline for their configurations, and if they
                find it well, I am more than happy to help that person. The third reason is just in
                case something happens to one of my laptops or my PC. I suggest that if you have
                configuration files, you should back them up on your preferred git host.</p>

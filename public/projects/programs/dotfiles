      <h3>What are Dotfiles?</h3><p>
      The reason I have dotfiles is for a few reasons. The first is that I use my PC and a few laptops interchangeably, and having my configurations easily downloadable is a big time saver. The second reason why I have my dotfiles up is because maybe somebody is looking for a certain baseline for their configurations, and if they find it well, I am more than happy to help that person. The third reason is just in case something happens to one of my laptops or my PC. I suggest that if you have configuration files, you should back them up on your preferred git host.</p>

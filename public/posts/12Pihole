      <h2>Pi-hole</h2>
      <h3>Date: 18-09-2024</h3><hr>
      <p>Been rather busy with school lately but I still have time to tinker!</p>

      <h2>What is Pi-hole ?</h2>
      <img class="right-image" width="200" src="../Images/logos/pihole.png">
      <p><a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-hole</a> is a DNS sinkhole that can be used with your router to protect your other devices without installing any client-side software. For the most part, Pi-hole is used for only blocking ads, but there is more you can do with it, for example, logging internet activity and blocking websites.

      <h2>benefits of using Pi-Hole</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Network wide adblocker</li>
        <li>Saves bandwith due to adblocker</li>
        <li>Adblocker on all mobile apps</li>
        <li><b>Free of cost</b></li>
        <li>Can function as a DHCP server</li>
        <li>Easy-to-install</li>
      </ul><hr>

      <h2>Installing</h2>
      <p>Since I'm using Arch Linux as my server OS, the only real option I had was to use the <a href="https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole">Docker container</a>. It was relatively easy to install, though I did encounter some issues, mostly due to me not reading what to do. Overall, I'd say it was easy to set up and configure for all my devices to use.</p>

      <h2>Blocklist</h2>
      <p>I have a number of websites blocked to avoid visiting suspicious sites or being tracked. The best source for blocklists from what I can tell is <a href="https://firebog.net/">Firebog</a>. I recommend using only the lists marked in <span style="color: green;">green</span>, as those coloured <span style="color: blue;">blue</span> are either no longer maintained or may interfere with your normal day to day web browsing. Additionally I would just add the top three lists from each category to cover a good enought basis.</p>

      <h2>Last thoughts</h2>
      <p>I really do like Pi-hole and I see myself using it for the forseeable future as it just does a whole bunch of intresting bits that help me be more secure online.</p>

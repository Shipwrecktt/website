      <h2>Compiling the Linux Kernel 🐧</h2>
      <h3>Date: 28-08-2024</h3><hr>

      <p>Today I have compiled the newest version of the Linux kernel being <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/?h=v6.10.6">6.10.6</a>!</p>
      <p>The main reason why I have done this is because whenever I try install to install <a href="https://gentoo.org">Gentoo</a> I fail. I do know you can convert a Linux distro into Gentoo but I want to install it from the ISO first before I do that.</p><hr>

      <h2>Was it easy?</h2>
      <p>I would say compiling the kernel was very easy; all I did was input a few commands and copy the defauly config over. There is not much I can say because compiling the kernel is not that complex, but one thing I will say is that my computer was crying during the process. </p>

      <h2>Results?</h2>
      <p>As of right now my computer and Laptop  both feel a bit faster now that a I have compilied the kernel, and now that I have learnt how to compile the Linux kernel I will now do it whenever I get a new laptop!</p>

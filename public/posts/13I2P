      <h2>Trying out I2P 🕵️</h2>

      <h1>What is I2P?</h1>
      <p><a href="https://i2p.net">I2P</a> stands for "The Invisible Internet Project" and it is a totally private and encrypted private network layer. If you have ever heard of or used the <a
            href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor project</a>, it is similar, but the I2P network is more secure and faster.</p>

      <h2>What is the point of using I2P?</h2>
      <p>This is a good question. Why should you or I even use I2P? The answer is simple: it offers many interesting things, for example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Over 7,000 unique websites to visit</li>
        <li>Free fully private Email address</li>
        <li>Private IRCs</li>
        <li>Fully decentralization</li>
        <li>Advanced userbase</li>
        <li>Faster than the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> and <a href="https://staging.freenetproject.org/">freenet</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Overall, I2P offers a lot to you and has an amazing community of friendly people.</p><hr>
      <h1>My experience</h1>
      <h2>Hosting on home server</h2>
      <p>I installed <a href="https://github.com/PurpleI2P/i2pd">i2pd</a> onto my home server. I chose i2pd because it is written in C, making it faster than the normal I2P package.</p>

      <p>After installing and starting up i2pd with Systemd, I had to forward the ports on my local network so that I could use I2P. This can be done by running a simple command:</p>
      <div class="code-box">
        <p>ssh -fTNL 4444:127.0.0.1:4444 -L 7070:127.0.0.1:7070 &lt;username&gt;</p>
      </div>

      <p>I would strongly suggest using <a href="https://librewolf.net/">Librewolf</a> to look through the I2P network.</p><hr>
      <p>Here are a few websites I do like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>http://notbob.i2p/</li>
        <li>http://ramble.i2p/</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Most of the websites on I2P are personal sites, and I highly suggest using NotBob to look for them because some of them are really cool.</p><hr>

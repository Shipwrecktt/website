        <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>If you are reading from a forgine country GCSEs stand for general certificate of secondary ecudation, as of right now I am taking them.</p>
<h2>Focus</h2>
<p>All I really need to focus on is math, my first paper is down and I only have two other maths papers, I need above a grade 4 ideally a grade 6. On my mock exams I got a grade 4 but this was my first set of mocks because for some reason the mocks I took in November finished when I started my GCSEs for some dumb reason. Thankfully these exams are easier then I imagined.</p>
<h2>What will I do when GCSEs are done?</h2>
<p>I plan to go to collage and partake in a course which allows me to further explore IT, I disliked IT class at secondary school because we only learnt about concepts; I am a pratical learner and this form of learning bascially killed me. But the course I am look at for collage seems very promissing and only a few people are allowed to enroll at once, so I do hope I get a possition!</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>That is all really it I just wanted to do a quick update. Sadly I have not been doing much tech related as you can see from my <a href="https://git.shupwreckt.co.uk/">GIT</a> since I am just focusing on GCSEs and myself.</p>

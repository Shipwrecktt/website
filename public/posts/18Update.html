      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Yo. It's been a little while since I’ve done much programming or updated the website. I’ve done the odd thing like setting up a CalDAV server and messing around with email, but that’s really it. Lately, I’ve just been focusing on school, and it’s kind of killing me—but boohoo, that’s just me. I’ll get through it if I keep trying; it’ll be over soon.</p>

      <p>I do have some good news! I’ve decided what to do after I leave school and finish my GCSEs—I want to do a T-level in computing. The interview went really well, and I was told the only thing I could improve on is my maths. So lately, I’ve been revising a lot of maths. I really want to do this T-level, but only 15 people (I believe) are allowed to do it because companies are unsure about allowing 16- to 18-year-olds to do placements at their workplaces. I’m going to work my ass off to get a spot! But just in case I can’t get that spot, hopefully, I can get an apprenticeship. I’m a practical learner—I like doing useful things instead of just sitting there studying. That’s why I love computers and operating systems; you’re always learning.</p>

      <h2>Misc things that has happened!</h2>
      <p>I have wanted to digitise my DVD collection for some time now, mainly my <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Father-Ted-Complete-Box-Set/dp/B008H2XE8I">Father Ted</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Planet-Apes-Collection-Disc-Box/dp/B00005NOMI">Planet of the Apes</a> box sets (used Amazon links because what else should I use?) because these two pieces of media are my favourite! But sadly, the discs are all encrypted, so I did some searching and found a neat piece of software called <a href="https://www.makemkv.com/">MakeMKV</a>, and it enabled me to copy the contents of the discs to my computer! Next thing to digitise is my PlayStation 3 collection of games.</p>

      <p>Also, to help me study, I deleted all my remaining social media accounts—those being Lemmy and Mastodon. I barely used them anyway; what’s the point of having them if I don’t use them and they’re made to distract? Although, when my GCSEs are over and I’m making some extra money, I may set up my own Mastodon service. We’ll have to see about that.</p>

      <h2>End</h2>
      <p>Very wordy post, not sorry about that because you have chosen to read this far. I hope you have enjoyed and I will try squeeze in a lil programming and website development where I can.</p>

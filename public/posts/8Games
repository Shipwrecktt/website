      <h2>Vidio games</h2>

      <p>I am going to try stop playing video games because it is just distracting me from working and learning. So I have uninstalled <a href="https://store.steampowered.com">Steam</a> on my main gaming computer. While I do love video games a lot and I have been playing them since I was a little kid, its something I should limit myself too, I will still play some games, mostly rythem games but apart from that I will be trying to stop playing video games all together.</p>

      <p>I might try modify some open source games and try make mods for them or something like that but apart from that I am quitting! That is really all, thank you for reading and I will try put out some more work!</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Today I have installed <a href="https://archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a> on my <a href="/posts/servers">home server</a>; I will be honest it has been so smooth!</p>
<p>I use Arch Linux as my desktop Linux distro, and I knew that you could use it as a server, but I never really thought of doing it. The only reason why I have done this is just to see how good it actually is because, well, I do not hear about people using it as a server much.</p>
<hr>
<h2>What do I have on the server? 📋</h2>
<p>I have all the same services that I hosted on my previous server install and more!</p>
<ul>
<li>Searxng 🔎</li>
<li>qBittorrent ⟳</li>
<li>Jellyfin 📺</li>
<li>MariaDB 📋</li>
</ul>
<p>I was thinking about adding Nextcloud to my server, but I can just use the scp command for backups, plus I do not have much to put on it due to the fact all my work is hosted on Gitlab.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Searxng 🔎</h2>
<p>Searxng is a metasearch engine that takes results from other search services. It does not track you; even the public ones don't! I like it because it gives me good results and it is easy to self-host, so I know 100%  that I am not being tracked. I did try to install it without Docker, but the guidedid not work for me, so I basically took the easy way out with the official Docker image that worked.</p>
<h2>qBittorrent ⟳</h2>
<p>I have the web UI of qBittorrent installed on my Arch Linux server. I used the Arch Linux guide on how to set it up, and I only really needed to install two programs. Then, just like that, everything is installed and working! It was really easy, and I am more satisfied with it. The reason why I have a torrent is just to support some Linux distros I like and have the ISOs ready when I need them.</p>
<h2>Jellyfin 📺</h2>
<p>Jellyfin is a free, as in freedom software, self-hosted media server. If you have ever used <a href="https://www.plex.tv/">Plex</a>, it is kind of like that, but Jellyfin is better because it has a whole load of <a href="https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/server/plugins/#official-plugins">plugins</a> and is licensed under the GPL-2.0, which makes it free software! But overall, it is an amazing media server, way better than Plex, so if you are able to switch over. I will be mostly hosting a few movies and books on it!</p>
<h2>MariaDB 📋</h2>
<p>MariaDB is a database server forked from <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>. The reason why I have this installed on my server is because I want to start learning how to use a database on a server because, from what I can tell, it looks really good on a CV, and you never know, it could be useful to me in the future!</p>
<hr>
<h2>Last words</h2>
<p>I will probably only use Arch Linux for servers because it is hassle-free and easy to use! That is all there is to say it was easy and less of a headache than <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>, at least in my experience.</p>
<p>But thank you for reading!</p>

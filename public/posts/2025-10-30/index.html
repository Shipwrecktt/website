        <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>It has been a while since I last wrote on this website, a few months actually, however from today on I shall try post more often. This post will just be an update to what I have been up too.</p>

<h2>Website</h2>
<img class="right-image" width="230" src="/images/logos/11ty.png">
Before I go into personal updates lets start with some website updates! If you have seen my website in the past you may think it has changed, and you would be correct; this is because I have switched from programming in pure HTML and CSS to using the <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a> static site generator with help from the vim plugin <a href="https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki">Vimwiki</a> to write my website from this point on. The reason why I have done this is to make maintaining and developing my website easier. 
<h3>Vimwiki</h3>
<p>This is Vim's version of org mode for Emacs. It allows for an individual to make their own wiki, I have altered the configuration to have another wiki which I use for this website meaning I can easily add updates and do other general bits.</p>
<h3>11ty</h3>
<p>11ty is a static site generator, most people say it is easy but for a newbie like myself there was a learning curb when it came to collections and such for setting up automated post updates on the index page, but when you get past complex wrinkles like that 11ty is really easy to use and makes sense when you understand how your configuration works.</p>

<h2>Personal life</h2>
<h3>Church</h3>
<p>Since my last update I have became an active member within my local church <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England">(Anglican)</a> and in the time I have last posted I have been baptized and confirmed. God has took root within my life and he plays an active roll within my life. I hope and pray over time I am able to become a better Christian and continue reading my Bible and prayer life. Over the last few months I have even became a servant within my local church, for the most part I am the crucifier, however depending on who is present that week my roll changes. Overall I think this is the most important event within my life, God has entered my life and I am so thankful for that.</p>
<p>I may even introduce a theology page once I do more research, but for now if you are interested you can see a list of churches I have been to <a href="/churches">here!</a></p>
<h3>College</h3>
<p>I have started my T-Level IT course and so far it is going well, my only complaint is I do not have any days off within the work week like most college students my age, however I do enjoy a lot of what we cover on this course and I have the chance to even do my work placement (Once a week) within the Methodist church! So I can benefit the church whilst receiving an education. I do hope that the interview goes well and that I will get the placement!</p>
<p>One of my biggest disliked of college is that it is hard to find friends, in the modern age of phones and social media people who are alone are just on their phone and therefore for the most unapproachable; it is either that or they are already with a group of people. Thankfully there are clubs two of which peak my interest the chess and debate, however sadly chess club is just when they put of chess boards out for students, what happens then is people who already know each other then play which then causes a bit of awkwardness when trying to meet people. The debate club I have not been to yet but I may pay it a visit next time it is on because I would like to learn how to debate. I did try and start a christian club, but I was denied because they were not 'looking to facilitate faith based groups' which I find iffy. However I will try to pull this off in the future when I find more people my age who are willing to help me create this project.</p>
<h3>Half term</h3>
<p>Right now as of writing it is half term, sadly I have been sick and I have not been able to do much due to my low amount of energy, however I try my best to be diligent so I have been able to do some things like overhaul my website, study, volunteer, and even do a full clean up of my room. I may also try play some video games, sadly I do not find games as fun anymore. I do deeply and truly hope that I feeling better by Sunday because I have been trained to administer the chalice to parishioners which is such an honour and humbles me deeply.</p>

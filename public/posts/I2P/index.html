        <h2>What is I2P?</h2>
<img class="right-image" width="250" src="/images/logos/i2p.png">
<a href="https://i2p.net/">I2P</a> stands for "The Invisible Internet Project" and it is a totally private and encrypted private network layer. If you have ever heard of or used the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor project</a>, it is similar, but the I2P network is more secure and faster.
<h3>What is the point of using I2P?</h3>
<p>This is a good question. Why should you or I even use I2P? The answer is simple: it offers many interesting things, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 7,000 unique websites to visit</li>
<li>Free fully private Email address</li>
<li>Private IRCs</li>
<li>Fully decentralization</li>
<li>Advanced userbase</li>
<li>Faster than the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> and <a href="https://staging.freenetproject.org/">freenet</a>
Overall, I2P offers a lot to you and has an amazing community of friendly people.</li>
</ul>

<h2>My experience</h2>
<p>I installed i2pd onto my home server. I chose i2pd because it is written in C, making it faster than the normal I2P package.</p>
<p>After installing and starting up i2pd with Systemd, I had to forward the ports on my local network so that I could use I2P. This can be done by running a simple command:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ssh -fTNL 4444:127.0.0.1:4444 -L 7070:127.0.0.1:7070 <username></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would strongly suggest using <a href="https://librewolf.net/">Librewolf</a> to look through the I2P network.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here are a few websites I do like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://notbob.i2p">&quot;&gt;http://notbob.i2p/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ramble.i2p">http://ramble.i2p/</a>
Most of the websites on I2P are personal sites, and I highly suggest using NotBob to look for them because some of them are really cool.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Most of the websites on I2P are personal sites. I highly suggest using NotBob to look for them because some of them are really cool.</p>

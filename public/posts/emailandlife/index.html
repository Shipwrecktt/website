        <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hello there, it has been a long while since I have posted to my website. I have just been busy with life and school.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Email</h2>
<p>If you have tried to look at this website the past few days, you may have noticed that it has been down, and that is because I have been trying to get an email server working again. Sadly God does not want me to set this server up because the VPS provider I was using <a href="https://shipwreckt.co.uk/posts/14Email.html">Digital Ocean</a> does not allow port 25, the port needed for Email. I know there is probably a way to tiptoe around this but I cannot be bothered. I have found 3 VPSes that do not block this port so I will hopefully get my awaited email server soon.</p>
<hr>
<h2>School</h2>
<p>School has been alright, just long days and homework. I have not had much time to program or mess around with Linux, but now that mocks are over, I might have some more time to mess around and learn. This whole setting up an email server thing is my latest Linux work, but I hope to do some more junk with servers soon.</p>

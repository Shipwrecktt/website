      <h2>Arch Linux Server!</h2>
      <h3>Date: 26-7-2024</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>Today I have installed <a href="https://archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a> on my <a href="04Servers">home server</a>; I will be honest it has been so smooth!</p>
      <p>I use Arch Linux as my desktop Linux distro, and I knew that you could use it as a server, but I never really thought of doing it. The only reason why I have done this is just to see how good it actually is because, well, I do not hear about people using it as a server much.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>What do I have on the server? 📋</h2>
      <p>I have all the same services that I hosted on my previus server install and more!</p> 
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/searxng/searxng">Searxng 🔎</a>
          <li><a href="https://www.qbittorrent.org/">qBittorrent ⟳</a>
          <li><a href="https://jellyfin.org/">Jellyfin 📺</a>
          <li><a href="https://mariadb.org/">MariaDB 📋</a>
      </ul>
      <p>I was thinking about adding <a href=https://nextcloud.com/install/>Nextcloud</a> to my server, but I can just use the scp command for backups, plus I do not have much to put on it due to the fact all my work is hosted on <a href="https://gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a>.</p>

      <h2>Searxng 🔎</h2>
      <p>Searxng is a metasearch engine that takes results from other search services. It does not track you; even the <a href="https://searx.space/">public ones</a> don't! I like it because it gives me good results and it is easy to self-host, so I know 100%  that I am not being tracked. I did try to install it without <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, but the <a href="https://docs.searxng.org/admin/installation-searxng.html">guide</a>did not work for me, so I basically took the easy way out with the official Docker image that worked.</p>

      <h2>qBittorrent ⟳</h2>
      <p>I have the web UI of qBittorrent installed on my Arch Linux server. I used the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/QBittorrent">Arch Linux guide</a> on how to set it up, and I only really needed to install two programs. Then, just like that, everything is installed and working! It was really easy, and I am more satisfied with it. The reason why I have a torrent is just to support some Linux distros I like and have the ISOs ready when I need them.</p>

      <h2>Jellyfin 📺</h2>
      <p>Jellyfin is a free, as in freedom software, self-hosted media server. If you have ever used <a href="https://www.plex.tv/">Plex</a>, it is kind of like that, but Jellyfin is better because it has a whole load of <a href="https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/server/plugins/#official-plugins">plugins</a> and is licensed under the <a href="https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/blob/master/LICENSE">GPL-2.0</a>, which makes it free software! But overall, it is an amazing media server, way better than Plex, so if you are able to switch over. I will be mostly hosting a few movies and books on it! </p>

      <h2>MariaDB 📋</h2>
      <p>MariaDB is a database server forked from <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>. The reason why I have this installed on my server is because I want to start learning how to use a database on a server because, from what I can tell, it looks really good on a CV, and you never know, it could be useful to me in the future!</p><hr>

      <h2>Last words</h2>
      <p>I will probably only use Arch Linux for servers because it is hassle-free and easy to use! That is all there is to say it was easy and less of a headache than <a href="https://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a>, at least in my experience.</p>
      <p>But thank you for reading!</p>

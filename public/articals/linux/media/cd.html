      <p>This is a quick tutorial to show you how to burn any file to a piece of optical disk media!</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Warning ⚠️</h3>
      <p>Once you burn an optical disk you cannot reburn it.</b>
    <p>Optical media does not have the best storage, normally under 1GiB so make sure your files align with the size of the optical media.</b>
  <hr>
  <h2>What you will need 📋</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Optical drive capable of writing to a CD</li>
    <li>A computer with Linux  🐧🖥️</li>
    <li>The ability to read instructions and to follow them 🧠</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>

  <h2>Steps to burn 🔥</h2>
  <p>You will only need one program to burn media to a CD; the name of that program is <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/wodim">wodim</a>, and it is part of a collection of programs called <a href="https://packages.debian.org/source/sid/cdrkit">cdrkit</a>, as in thename ofe this collection of programs that allow you to do a whole variaty of things withopticall media! 
  <hr>

  <li>1) Install cdrkit, on some Linux distrobutions cdrkit is already installed, but on my main Linux distrobution <a href="https://archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a>, it is not so check you have it installed, the package on your distro will most likely be called cdrkit.</li>
  <br>
  <div class="code-box">
    <p>sudo pacman -S cdrkit</p>
  </div>
  <br>

  <hr>

  <li>2) You want to get whatever data you want into an ISO file, so if you had a file called movies that held movies you would use the command. As an example, I will be using the location of the Fallout 1 installation files on my system.</li><br>
  <div class="code-box">
    <p>mkisofs -o Fallout.iso -V "Fallout 1" ~/Downloads/Fallout</p>
  </div>
  <p>Fallout.iso being the output ISO and ~/Downloads/Fallout being the directory with the movies in there.</p>

  <hr>

  <li>3) Now the last command is the actual event of burning the optical media! So insert it into your optical drive and type this command.</li><br>
  <div class="code-box">
    <p>cdrecord -v de=/dev/cdrom ~/Downloads/Fallout</p>
  </div>
  <p>movies.iso being the output ISO from the last command.</p>

  <hr>

  <li>4) Now it is time to sit back and wait for it to burn; do not get impatient; give it time, and it will burn. When it is done, you may enject the optical media from the CD drive, and it should have all the files you desire.</li><br>

    <hr><p>That is all the required steps to burn optical media on Linux, I hope this has helped you!</p>

      <h2>How to stay safe online</h2>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>Computers are always at risk. No matter how much work you do or how hard you try, there will always be a way to hack your system. In this article I will share how I keep my computers safe and the tools I use to do so.</p>
      <h3>Passwords</h3>
      <p>Passwords are the main way people get into our computers and online accounts. So it is key to have strong passwords, so hackers have a hard time finding out what the passwords are. So what does a strong password consist of? A strong password should consist of a sequence of special characters (like?, #, and $) and normal characters. A strong password should also not have any words found in the dictionary, so that rules out many people's passwords.</p>
      <p font color="#9433ff">An example of a weak password would be: <br>
      <font color="white">Password123</font>
      <p font color="#9433ff">And an example of a strong password would be: <br>
      <font color="white">{gÙIjWÝ0ó{Ðö÷åQü9+òÀË×?Ì¯Áv</font>
      <p>Now you may be wondering, How the hell do I remember all of that, and for multiple accounts, none the less, well easily with KeePassXC? I personally use KeePassXC for my password management, mostly because it is offline, meaning you are not trusting a company with your data. I also find it very easy to use, and it has many features I like, for example, two-factor authentication, customisation options, and a password generator, all built into it.</p>
      <h3>Browser</h3>
      <p>Many people argue over what is the best browser for privacy, and many people have the argument over <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> or <a href="https://brave.com/">the Brave brower</a>, and there are many good arguments for one or the other. But personally, I do not take part in this debate because it is obvious what the best privacy-based browser is <a href="https://librewolf.net/">Librewolf</a>. The reason why Librewolf is better than Brave and Firefox is for a large number of reasons, mainly because the people who develop Librewolf care about privacy, and it comes with uBlock Origin, which is an ad block that is very useful.</p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>That is all that I do to remain safe online, all the rest is common sense like not using windows, not downloading suspisous files online and not telling other people personal infomations. So I do hope you have enjoyed reading this and I will publish more articles in the future.</p>

      <p>Little note here, much of this artical is knowlage I have learnt overtime that is why there is a lack of resources.</p>

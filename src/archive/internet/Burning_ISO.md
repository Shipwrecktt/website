## why?
The internet is constantly evolving and changing. It is hard to stay safe online in the modern world, and with this, it is hard to protect your personal data from others online, so much so that over 40% of the UK's adult population has experienced some form of online crime. So in answer to the question, 'How do I stay safe online?' I have compiled this series of articles in order for you, the reader, to educate yourself on online safety.

## Profiles
We all have online profiles, whether with [Google](https://about.google/?fg=1) or [X (Twitter)](twitter.com); you are probably reading this to make sure your online accounts are secure, and I am here to help you do just that, so let's just get into it!

### The less the better

What do I mean by this? You may be thinking, well, I mean, the fewer online accounts you have to manage, the more secure you are overall! So if you have any accounts you do not use anymore or any accounts you do not need, I would suggest deleting them.

### No connections!

A lot of online services like [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) offer an option to sign up to their service with your Google or Facebook account. Now this may seem convenient, and it is, but it is a bad idea. It is a bad idea because if your Google or Facebook accounts get hacked into, all of these connected accounts are now compromised, and you cannot do anything about it because you cannot log into the account you connected it all to.

### Common sense!

Use your common sense! Do not share any of your passwords unless you absolutely have tools. If a website seems off and you feel uncomfortable, leave the website.

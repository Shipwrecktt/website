## Password managers

In the modern day you do not need to remember your passwords thanks to password managers! But what password managers can you turst and use?

I only suggest one password manager, that being [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org), and the reason why I suggest KeePassXC is because the source code is available to view so you know you can trust it, and the other reason why I suggest using KeePassXC is because it is offline, meaning nobody can hack an online account; instead, they have to obtain the password.kdbx file on your computer, which is harder to do than hacking an online account.

Due to the fact that KeePassXC works offline with a .kdbx file, I suggest having a spare USB stick with a backup on it just in case it gets deleted for whatever reason.

Syncing all of your passwords between devices is easy with KeePassXC; I just use [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) to do so. It is easy to setup, and I have never had any issues with it!

## What makes a good password?

A good password should be made up of totally random charicters that have no relation to you as a person.

An example of a weak password would be:  

> Grace'sPassword123

And an example of a strong password would be:  
> {gÙIjWÝ0ó{Ðö÷åQü9+òÀË×?Ì¯Áv

Now you might see why you should have a password manager, so it can remember stuff like this for you!

I do suggest your password to be longer than 16 charicters!

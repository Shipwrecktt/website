## Introduction
Over the last few days in my free time, I have been messing around with <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a> to make some wallpapers and a profile picture. I do admit this is something I plan to do more of, so I have made a page on my projects page for all of the art I have done! Below are some examples of what I have done so far; I am exited to do some more!

## Introduction
Today I have compiled the newest version of the Linux kernel being 6.10.6!

The main reason why I have done this is because whenever I try install to install Gentoo I fail. I do know you can convert a Linux distro into Gentoo but I want to install it from the ISO first before I do that.

## Was it easy?
I would say compiling the kernel was very easy; all I did was input a few commands and copy the defauly config over. There is not much I can say because compiling the kernel is not that complex, but one thing I will say is that my computer was crying during the process. 

## Results?
As of right now my computer and Laptop both feel a bit faster now that a I have compilied the kernel, and now that I have learnt how to compile the Linux kernel I will now do it whenever I get a new laptop!

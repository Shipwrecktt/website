## It is over!!!

GCSEs are over! The exams were less stressful then I initally thought, however the exams were draining. The reason why this post is coming out so late is becasue last few weeks I have just been focused on myself.

### Will I miss school?

Nope! I will miss some of the teachers but overall I am happy school is over, mainly due to the fact I had to take a bus to school and every school day I spent 2 hours total a day commuting to school and back and the trip back really killed me.

### What have I been up too?

Sadly I have not been doing much tech stuff, apart from messing around with different programs of course. I have mostly been spedning my time at church and reading the Bible, overall just connecting more with God and improving myself to be a better person over all! However I have been looking for a new VPS that allows port 22 (SMTP port) and does not block the port, however if I keep my current subscription long enough the support team said they would be able to lift the SMTP port block, so I will just stick with that, however it is a bit of a pain not being able to send mail from my mail account.

## Overview

Hopefully I will be able to go to collage, we will have to see though and I am just so happy that I am done with secondary school!
